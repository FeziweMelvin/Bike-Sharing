# Bike-Sharing-
The bike-sharing rental process is significantly influenced by environmental and seasonal factors. Weather conditions, precipitation, weekday, season, the hour of the day, and so on can all influence renting behaviour. The goal is to predict bike rental count (hourly/daily) based on the environmental &amp; seasonal settings
